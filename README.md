# ArtemisFinancial

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Finanical is a financial institution that deals in banking and insurance options. They wanted to modernize their operations and to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. They wanted me to assess and report any vulnerabilities, as well as provide any options for improvement moving forward. They wanted a Vulnerabilities Assessment Report as well as a mitigation plan for moving forward.

2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I had the most success with the manual review of the code. I worked through the code from beginning to end very quickly and was able to successfully identify the vulnerabilities. I was also successful in using a static testing to find and provide solutions to those vulnerabilites. Software security is important for this company in particular because it is handling sensitive user information that, if released, could cause significant legal liabilities for the company. 

3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I am not particularly skilled in the process of presenting my findings. I have spent most of my coding career simply solving the problems I come across, and haven't practiced the art of report writing. I enjoyed the static testing process. Using a Maven vulnerabilities test and report made it much easier to see vulnerabilities I would have normally missed through manual code review. 

4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
Using the Vulnerabilities Flow Chart, I was able to look at each level of the code. Looking at the code as a whole can be a big bite to chew, but the flow chart allows me to use it as a checklist looking at the different layers of security. Looking through the full code through different pairs of glasses, allowing me to focus on one layer at a time. 

5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I was able to run the code through a dependencies check. This allowed me to assess build success as well as looking for any newly introduced vulnerabilities as I refactored the code. By comparing the two dependency checks side by side.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Iron Clad Java was a wonderful resources in learning about the levels of code security and different options to make that code function. I also used the CISSP study guide to further understand helpful methods to secure code. I enjoyed using the dependency checks to find vulnerabilities as well. Moving forward, I will definitely be referencing these materials. 

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I feel as thought my report is clean and concise. I would love to show that as an example moving forward. In my projects, I also successfully chose and implemented algorithms. This would help future employers see that I understand how to assess different algorithms and how to choose the best suited to a project as well as implement it.
